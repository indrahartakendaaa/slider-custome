        <p>Before you’re a business owner who develops an application or runs a website, you were a customer first. You know how it’s like to use a website or application that makes you feel confused or to buy something that doesn’t work as right as you want it to. Now that you’ve been in your customer’s shoes, you can’t afford to make them frustrated when using your products. You need to give them the best experience possible.</p>
        <p>UX, or user experience, is the answer. It’s a process of improving customer satisfaction through the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product. Revolving around the experience of a user and their thought process, UX covers every aspect of your customers’ interaction with your brands, products, and services. It’s what makes them either want to use your product again or avoid it instead.</p>

        <h3>Helps you guide the user to the desired action</h3>
        <p>You create an app or a website for certain reasons. You want your visitors to do things that you want them to do. UX will help you achieve that goal by providing a more efficient and natural navigation throughout your website. With a simple navigation, your visitors are more likely to spend longer time on your website. The longer they’re on your site, the more likely they are to complete directed actions.</p>

        <h3>Seamless product development</h3>
        <p>As a business owner, you want your app or website to be scalable. UX allows you to do so since most of the UX design is data-driven. Ideally, UX design uses heatmap tools to provide data about their visitors. Heatmap tools give you a visual representation of a visitor’s click, taps, and scrolling behaviors. By knowing your visitor’s behavior, you’re able to make necessary changes to improve the user experience of your website or app. The more data you have, the better decisions you can make, therefore reducing the chance of failure.</p>

        <h3>Higher Customer Engagement</h3>
        <p>What’s the point of making an app or a website if no one wants to visit it? That’s why you need a good UX design so that your visitors can easily navigate the app / website and understand how to use it. Put yourself in your customer’s shoes. If you stumble upon a app / website with sloppy design, chances are you won’t come back to use it again. Neither are your visitors. </p>
        <p>By implementing good UX practice, you develop an interaction-rich experience, which will drive users back to your site. If they spend more time on your product, that means you’ve engaged them. And higher engagement is more likely to drive more conversions, which will lead to better product sales.</p>

        <h3>Reduces business cost and times </h3>
        <p>In order to pull an effective UX design on your product, you need to conduct a customer research first. You need to understand whom you’re building it for and why you’re building it. And since you have already a clearer picture in mind of what you’re building, you’ll be able to create a shorter product development time upfront. In Antikode, we always start with research first, which involves user interview, creating UX persona, and other techniques with one thing in mind: making sure that the product / feature fit the needs of the customers.</p>
        <p>UX is all about experience and emotion a user feels when using your product, app, or website. Having a website with good UX provides you with more benefits for creating higher engagement with your customers and growing your brand. </p>
